Here I keep some Python notebooks with the mostly use codes on my daily as a Data Scientist.



#### [01. Cross-validation for Classification Machine Learning Model](github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Cross-validation%20for%20Classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)<br>
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use cross-validation to verify the classification ML model quality.


#### [02. Predict() and Predict_Proba() for Classification Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Predict%20and%20Predict%20Proba%20for%20Classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use predict(), that results on a dummy variable, and predict_proba() that results on a probability to happens the event.


#### [03. Saving and Loading your Machine Learning Model](github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Saving%20and%20Loading%20your%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to save a ML model and, after this step, to load then for use normally.


#### [04. qcut() for build a scores to the classification Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/qcut()%20for%20build%20a%20scores%20to%20the%20classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use pandas.qcut() to build a score classes to the classification ML model.


#### [05. Building a confusion matrix to analyse my Classification Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Building%20a%20confusion%20matrix%20to%20analyse%20my%20Classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use crosstab() to build a confusion matrix and calulate accuracy, precision and recall.


#### [06. Building Decision Tree Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Building%20Decision%20Tree%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how train a machine learning model using Decision Tree algorithm for classification.
