Here I keep some Python notebooks with the mostly use codes on my daily as a Data Scientist.



#### [01. Cross-validation for Classification Machine Learning Model](github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Cross-validation%20for%20Classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)<br>
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use cross-validation to verify the classification ML model quality.


#### [02. Predict() and Predict_Proba() for Classification Machine Learning Model]([https://bit.ly/3zwHkAu](https://github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Predict%20and%20Predict%20Proba%20for%20Classification%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb))
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to use predict(), that results on a dummy variable, and predict_proba() that results on a probability to happens the event.


#### [03. Saving and Loading your Machine Learning Model](github.com/lincolntneves/Shorts-About-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Notebooks/Saving%20and%20Loading%20your%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)
The objective of this notebook is only to show up how to save a ML model and, after this step, to load then for use normally.
